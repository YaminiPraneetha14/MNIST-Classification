# MNIST-Classification

The purpose of this notebook is to use the classic MNIST handwritten digit dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, and predict the class of image data. 
The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels depicting digits 0-9.
To classify these digits, a dense neural network using the Keras library is built. The model architecture comprises multiple layers of densely connected neurons, with the final output layer having 10 units, one for each digit class. The model is trained using several gradient descent algorithms and calculated against several loss metrics.
